;; Exercise 3.
;; -----------
;; Add the following two lines to the definitions area:
;;
;;    (define str "helloworld")
;;    (define i 5)
;;
;; Then create an expression using string primitives that adds "_" at position
;; i. In general this means the resulting string is longer than the original
;; one; here the expected result is "hello_world".

;; Position means i characters from the left of the string, but programmers
;; start counting at 0. Thus, the 5th letter in this example is "w", because
;; the 0th letter is "h". Hint When you encounter such “counting problems” you
;; may wish to add a string of digits below str to help with counting:
;; 
;;    (define str "helloworld")
;;    (define ind "0123456789")
;;    (define i 5)
;; 
;; See exercise 1 for how to create expressions in DrRacket.
